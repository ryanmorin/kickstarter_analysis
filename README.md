# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is organizing a play called Fever. To fund the play Louise started a Kickstarter campaign. 
Louise's kickstarter campaign was not successful.

### Purpose
Louise would like to understand how different campaigns faired based on their launch dates and whether
they achieved their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The total number of campaigns has increased by over 660% since 2009. The largest Kickstarter category is Theater. 
Theater comprised over 40% of the total campaigns since 2014. Theater's average success rate (successful campaigns / total campaigns)
since 2014 has been over 65%. The most successful months to launch a Theater campaign is May and June and the worst month is December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-   1. The number of successful campaigns has increased since 2009
-   2. The number of failed or cancelled campaigns has also increased since 2009

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
